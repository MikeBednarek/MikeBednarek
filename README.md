### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mike Bednarek.
 I am a senior at Denison University double majoring in Data Analytics & Economics. My interests include sports, the outdoors, and music. I am open to all jobs in 2024, but am looking to get into consulting or data management. I hope to showcase some of my coding skills and my senior Data Analytics Capstone project on this page.
